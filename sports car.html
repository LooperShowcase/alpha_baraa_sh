    <p>A sports car is a car designed with an emphasis on dynamic performance, such as handling, acceleration, top speed, the thrill of driving, and racing capability. Sports cars originated in Europe in early 1902 and are currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.
        <title>Definition</title>
        Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic performance,[2][3] without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and Ferrari 488 Pista can be considered sports cars, despite vastly different levels of performance. Broader definitions of sports cars include cars "in which performance takes precedence over carrying capacity",[4] or that emphasise the "thrill of driving"[5] or are marketed "using the excitement of speed and the glamour of the (race)track"[6] However, other people have more specific definitions, such as "must be a two-seater or a 2+2 seater"[7] or a car with two seats only.[8][9]
