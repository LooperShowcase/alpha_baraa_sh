      A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose microcomputer whose size,
      capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use.[1] Personal
      computers are intended to be operated directly by an end user, rather than
      by a computer expert or technician. Unlike large, costly minicomputers and
      mainframes, time-sharing by many people at the same time is not used with
      personal computers. Primarily in the late 1970s and 1980s, the term home
      computer was also used. The advent of personal computers and the
      concurrent Digital Revolution have significantly affected the lives of
      people in all countries.
